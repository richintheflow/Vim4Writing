# Vim4Writing

The package includes a .vimrc file with essential settings tailored for novel writing. It features a 75-character soft wrap configuration, along with a word count display at the bottom of the screen. The word count also includes a line that aggregates the total number of words in the current paragraph, making it easier to manage and format your text.

Additionally, the setup comes with three dictionaries (French, English, and Spanish) and three thesauruses (French, English, and Spanish), ensuring comprehensive language support.

Vim4Writing is the ideal Vim configuration for writing novels and prose.
