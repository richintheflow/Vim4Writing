# Vim4Writing

It contains the .vimrc file with the basic configuration to write a novel  with a 75 characters soft auto wrap configuration and a word count line    added at the bottom. 
The line counting is also configured to see a total paragraph in one line. It helps to format the text. 

It also contains 3 thesaurus and 3 dictionaries in French, English and     Spanish.

Vim4Writing is the ideal vim configuration to write novels and prose.

'<F3>' no spell configuration
'<F4>' French dictionary activated
'<F5>' English dictionary activated
'<F6>' Spanish dictionary activated

'<F7>' French Thesaurus activated
'<F8>' English Thesaurus activated

When a thesaurus is activated, it can't switch to another one. So it needs to  be set from the launch.
